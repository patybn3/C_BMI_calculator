## Week 3-4 Assignment 4_1 - NECC
## Professor Ethel Schuster
## Student Patricia Antlitz

### This program takes user input using built-in function scanf from the stdio library.

##### User interactions:

- Asks for the user's weight in pounds.
- Asks for height in feet.

Assignment 1 - A BMI calculator, takes the user input for weight and height and returns the user's BMI as well as the recommended amount of lbs the user should gain or lose to obtain an average normal BMI.
    - Challenges faced during this assignment:
The assignment was overall not complicated, the instructions were to ask for the user's height in inches, but if the user is like me, they wont know what their height in inches from the top of their head. I believe it is not very user friendly to have the user calculate what their height is in inches. So the challenge was to convert the user's entry in feet and inches into inches taking into consideration the entry was a float and not an integer. Once the conversion from float to int was figured out, the development ran smoothly. No other problems encounterd.
